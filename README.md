## “Shopping list for families” application helps families creating dynamic shopping list together.

The main idea is that anyone can sign-up into this application and create a “family” by inviting other registered users into it. Any member of the family can create a shopping list and add items with their quantities into it. The other members of the family can also add items with quantities into it. When a family member is shopping using the list, she or he can mark the individual items with quantities as picked up. The shopping list can be closed or removed by a family member. Typically, this is done after the shopping is done. It is not possible to add new items with quantities to a closed or removed shopping list.
